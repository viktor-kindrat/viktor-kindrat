# Welcome to my GitHub ✨👋🏻

I am a sixteen year old web developer located in Ukraine 🇺🇦. I started my career in web development by studying at the Creator IT Academy. I started my way in IT only in 2021, but I already have a number of projects that are worth noting. My portfolio includes both HTML / CSS, web design projects and JS-based projects.
